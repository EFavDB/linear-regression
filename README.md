# Interpreting results of linear regression

Based on the discussion in a
[blog post](http://efavdb.com/interpreting-linear-regression).
Generate synthetic data for the weight, height, and shoe size of adult
women and fit two models:

* weight ~ height
* weight ~ height + shoe_size

Manually calculate confidence intervals, p-values of t-tests and F-tests, and
compare to the summary report generated by the python library `statsmodels.api`.
